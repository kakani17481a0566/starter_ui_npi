âœ… 1. Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js (Current Version) from the official website:

ðŸ‘‰ https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll need to install Yarn.

âœ… 2. Allow PowerShell Script Execution (Windows Only)

If you're using PowerShell on Windows, run the following command to temporarily allow script execution:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass


This is safe and only applies to the current session.

âœ… 3. Install Yarn

Install Yarn globally using npm:

npm install -g yarn

âœ… 4. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroPi.git
cd NeuroPi


Replace the URL with your actual GitHub repo link.

âœ… 5. Install Project Dependencies

Install all required packages using Yarn:

yarn

âœ… 6. Start the Development Server
yarn dev


This will start the app at:

http://localhost:3000


(or another port, depending on your setup).

âœ… Done!

You should now have the project running locally ðŸŽ‰
